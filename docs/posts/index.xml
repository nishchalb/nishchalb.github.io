      <description>Pastel colors are a useful tool to have in your photography toolkit. Editing images with this style can help you take advantage of bright harsh light, lack of shadows, and colorful elements.
What is a pastel color? Wikipedia says they have &amp;ldquo;high value and low saturation&amp;rdquo;. With paint, you can achieve them by &amp;ldquo;mixing white&amp;rdquo; with your standard colors. But how can we do this in darktable?
To understand how we can accomplish this, its helpful to look at the diagrams in the darktable manual on color dimensions.</description>

      <title>Darktable: Emulate Film Halation</title>

      <description>I recently came across an article about the halation effect in film (check out that article if you are interested in a description of the effect). I wanted to emulate the effect using darktable, and thankfully the Diffuse or Sharpen module that was released in darktable 3.8 makes this pretty easy.
The method I will describe below is heavily based on one by one of the authors of the module.</description>

      <description>A while ago, someone asked online how to recreate the look of sanghan. Here is my attempt at showing how to do this using darktable 3.6.
Here is the end product of the edit. I found this image on Signature Edits
Here is our starting point. Notice that the conditions are similar to the images we are using as inspiration. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier to achieve a look when your lighting conditions are close.</description>
