# Concept

Secret Wizard Corporation is a small prototype game designed and created in two weeks by Nishchal Bhandari, Isaac Rosado, Pravina 
Saratunga, and Rachel Thornton for the MIT class CMS.611/6.073 Creating Video Games. The game is designed as a flow puzzle 
game with the addition of magical powers to help when players get stuck. To be successful, players must balance their 
actions between traditional pipe rotations and magical abilities. The goal for this project was to develop a semi-polished game prototype 
that featured an interesting trade-off as a mechanic.

# Technologies Used


Secret Wizard Corporation was built using Phaser, an HTML5 game framework. The game should run well on most systems using any modern browser.
